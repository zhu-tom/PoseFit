The COVID-19 pandemic has made it extremely difficult to be mentally healthy. Remaining restricted to the confines of your home and increased stress levels due to losing jobs and loved ones is a major part of this. Often people believe the physical and mental health are separate things, while in reality it is synonymous. Trying to stay healthy and fit at home is extremely difficult. Given the lockdown in Ontario, where public gyms are closed, the quality of your workouts is limited. MyTrainer aims to bridge the gap between gym and home workouts. Our mobile app, built with React-Native uses Tensorflow's Posenet to analyze a user's form while providing real-time feedback.
